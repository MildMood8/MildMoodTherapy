          Step into Mild Mood Therapy, a haven where diversity is celebrated and hearts have room
          to breathe. Based in Melbourne, Florida, the practice centers the vibrancy of the
          LGBTQIA+ community and welcomes people of all sexual orientations, gender identities,
          and expressions.

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          At Mild Mood Therapy, you are not just a diagnosis or a checklist. You are a whole
          person with a story, identities, and experiences that deserve care and respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The practice offers LGBTQIA+ affirming, culturally aware therapy that holds space for
          the intersections of race, culture, gender, sexuality, trauma, and systems. Together,
          we explore what it looks like to move toward self-acceptance, empowerment, and
          authenticity on your own terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you are navigating coming out, exploring gender, working through relationship
          stress, or simply wanting a place to land and exhale, this is a space where you can
          bring your full self.
