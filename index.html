          Mild Mood Therapy is a warm, affirming telehealth practice based in Melbourne, Florida,

          relationships, and healing.

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          At Mild Mood Therapy, you are more than a diagnosis or a “case.” You are a whole person
          with a story, identities, and experiences that deserve to be seen and respected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The practice centers LGBTQIA+ affirmative care and welcomes people of all sexual
          orientations, gender identities, and expressions, as well as allies. Sessions are rooted
          in compassion, curiosity, and collaboration so you can explore what it means to live more
          authentically on your own terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          We honor how culture, race, gender, sexuality, trauma, and systems shape mental health,
          and we work alongside you to move toward self-acceptance, empowerment, and sustainable
          change.

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Mild Mood Therapy exists to be a soft landing place in a world that often asks you to be
          smaller, quieter, or different than you are. The mission is simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a space where every part of you is allowed in the room.</li>
          <li>Offer culturally aware, identity-affirming care that honors lived experience.</li>
          <li>Support you in building a life that feels more aligned, grounded, and authentic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are invited to come exactly as you are and explore what healing, growth, and
          self-discovery can look like when you do not have to perform or shrink.
